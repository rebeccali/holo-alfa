Like all children, the Dentist has had a lot of growing pains. In the design, we've done an overhaul of the internal frame. In the first iteration of the drive pods, we noticed that excessive amounts of precision machining was slowing us down in progress. In the interest of time, we've switched over to a welded tube frame for the internals while still preserving the external structure.

The old CAD is on the left, and the new CAD is on the right.

The picture shows an elimination of our self righting mechanism in favor of both weight and lowering complexity. The basic aluminum-titanium armor will be kept through out, but with the addition of welded front wedgelets and back armor for quick-and-dirty assembly.
