This weekend was a lot of fabrication - we are finishing up the first iteration of the drive pods and also trying out other pieces of armor.

Landon did the good ol' lasercut and hot glue gun to test and make sure the front wedgelets were manufacturable. The wedgelets function to push our opponents up into the drum.

Landon also went and machined out the first version of our drum sides ([which looks very similar to Hypershock][hypershock]). He only broke 2 endmills! +2 machining points to Landon.
