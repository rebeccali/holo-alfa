When we first starting building the robot, Bayley was intent on using the Prius motor to power our drum. With 80kW of power and a max speed of 8000rpm, it makes for a powerful drum limited only by air resistance and the fact that we want to throw our opponent, not mill them. The Prius motor would be hooked up through a reverser to the weapon, which would spin at 16,000 rpm. 

But before Priuses can live in robots, they have to be freed from the engine block. We decided to keep the motor in its original housing and mount that to the robot, so the process involved gently carving the motor out of the cast aluminum engine block. The resulting pile of chips (15 pounds!) are below:

In the end, we still had a motor that weighed 47 lbs - a little heavy but what else do you spend your 250 lbs on!
