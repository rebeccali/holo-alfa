The MIT Combat Robotics Club is a club dedicated to creation of amazing engineering feats and destruction of other robots. Particularly, we are interested in creating a robot which pushes the boundaries of what is possible for competition. 

Inspired by the reboot last year of [BattleBots on ABC][bb], our team decided to submit a robot for this year's entry. We are happy to confirm that we are entrants into Season to of [BattleBots][bb].

Our team is composed of MIT undergraduates and graduate students interested in creating novel high energy robots. The club was born in September of 2015, and is owner of the Dentist robot.

**Team Captain**: Rebecca Li, undergraduate in Mechanical Engineering and concentrating in Robotics, class of 2017

**Mechanical Lead**: Landon Carter, undergraduate in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science, class of 2017. He likes mechanical design, computers, and dislikes compilers for both.

**Electrical Lead**: Bayley Wang, studied electrical engineering at MIT. His main hobby is making power systems using transistors larger than most people have ever seen. His recent creations include high-voltage devices, induction heaters, laser drivers, and power converters. His growing collection of surplus equipment overflows his room. He recreationally arbitrages CPUs on eBay and re-sells surplus optical equipment for a profit that makes his friends jealous.

**Team Members**: Daniel Kramnik, Tyler Hamer, Michael DeTienne, Daniel Gonzalez (not pictured), Maura Hennessey, Victor Hung
